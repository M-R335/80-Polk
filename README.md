Current work Project, for Polk building company website 80% done. Currently only have permission to show gif not source code. But likely will have everything up soon. Only 60% of pages shown in gif(does it no justice), but wanted to present. Front is react w tailwind and SWC and backend is Django for form handling and likely will be hosting on AWS or on local Linux server.
